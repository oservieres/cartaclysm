# Cartaclysm
A local multiplayer car game made with Unity. Made for fun. My first Unity Project, so don't judge me.

This is a proof of concept.

# Gameplay
A mix between [Mashed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashed), [Split Second](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1Vkc86jI80) and [Bad Boys II](https://youtu.be/bvPWI_IOxCQ?t=29s).
I trying to reproduce the feeling of playing with toys : tiny cars, weird physics, cartoon explosions, sound effects by mouth.
