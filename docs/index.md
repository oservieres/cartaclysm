# What is this ?

Cartaclysm is a free and open source prototype. It is a game playable by 4 players on the same screen. The game is mainly multiplayer. You can play alone, but I think it will not be much interesting until a proper single player mode with goals and achievements is added, maybe one day.

# Known issues

It may be hard to quit the game: the pause menu is quite bugged. Do not hesitate to use `ALT + F4` or `CMD + Q`.
