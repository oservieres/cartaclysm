# What is this ?

Cartaclysm is a free and open source prototype. It is a game playable by 4 players on the same screen. It is a car-game, but not a race: the winner is not the one who finishes first, it is the one who finishes alive with the most points earned by completing challenges.

The game is mainly multiplayer. You can play alone, but I think it will not be much interesting until a proper single player mode with goals and achievements is added, maybe one day.

It may be hard to quit the game: the pause menu is quite bugged. Do not hesitate to use `ALT + F4` or `CMD + Q`.
