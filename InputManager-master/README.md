## Introduction
*InputManager* is a custom input manager for Unity that allows you to rebind keys at runtime and abstract input devices(through input configurations) for cross platform input.

### Features
- Very simple to implement. It has the same public methods and variables as Unity's **Input** class
- Allows you to customize key bindings at runtime
- Allows you to convert touch input to axes and buttons on mobile devices
- Allows you to bind script methods to various input events(e.g. when the user presses a button or key) through the inspector
- Run up to four input configurations at the same time for easy local co-op input handling
- Save the key bindings to a file, to PlayerPrefs or anywhere else by implementing a simple interface
- Seamless transition from keyboard to gamepad with the InputAdapter addon
- Works with the new UI system introduced in Unity 4.6

## Platforms
Compatible with Windows 7, Windows 8 Desktop, Windows 8 Store, Linux, Mac OSX, WebPlayer and Android(not tested on iOS but it might work). Requires the latest version of Unity.
